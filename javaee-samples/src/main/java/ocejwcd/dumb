**Introduction**
Variables used to be synchronised with the calling jsp.

**name-given=”output_name”**

* declares the name of scoped attribute to be defined in the calling jsp.
* also the name of the local attribute in the tag file whose value is to be synchronised

**name-from-attribute=”action_attribute_name”**

* declares the name of scoped attribute to be defined in the calling jsp.
* that name is from the translation time value of the attribute called action_attribute_name. !!
* this attribute should have following attributes set
    1. required=”true”
    2. rtexprvalue=”false”
    3. type=”java.lang.String”
* translation error will occur if the previous action_attribute_name wasn’t defined or is not set as mentioned
* the following alias should be also there or translation error will occur

**alias=”local_name”**

* declares the name of the locally scoped attribute to hold the value of that variable.
* required along with name-from-attribute translation error will happen if not.

**variable-class**

* default is java.lang.String
* fully qualified name of the class of this variable.
* no primitives permitted

**declare**

* if require container to create this variable if it doesn’t already exist, use true.
* if you rely on it already existing use false.

**description**

* textual description, has limited use in assembly and deployment.

**scope**

* this is the synchronisation scope not (page, request etc ) scopes
* page scope is always used btw
* AT_BEGIN
* AT_END
* NESTED (default)
* Synchronisation here is  different from last chapter: synchronisation here is between scoped attributes in the tag file and scoped attributes in the calling jsp. 
* In the last chapter synchronisation was between scoped attributes(available concurrently in both tag handler and the calling jsp) and jsp scripting variables in the calling jsp.
