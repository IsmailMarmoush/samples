    /*
     * Searches are performed using the binarySearch() method.
     *
     * Successful searches return the int index of the element being
     * searched.
     *
     * Unsuccessful searches return an int index that represents the
     * insertion point. The insertion point is the place in the
     * collection/array where the element would be inserted to keep the
     * collection/array properly sorted. Because positive return values and
     * 0 indicate successful searches, the binarySearch() method uses
     * negative numbers to indicate insertion points. Since 0 is a valid
     * result for a successful search, the first available insertion point
     * is -1. Therefore, the actual insertion point is represented as
     * (-(insertion point) -1). For instance, if the insertion point of a
     * search is at element 2, the actual insertion point returned will be
     * -3.
     *
     * The collection/array being searched must be sorted before you can
     * search it.
     *
     * If you attempt to search an array or collection that has not already
     * been sorted, the results of the search will not be predictable.
     *
     * If the collection/array you want to search was sorted in natural
     * order, it must be searched in natural order. (Usually this is
     * accomplished by NOT sending a Comparator as an argument to the
     * binarySearch() method.)
     *
     * If the collection/array you want to search was sorted using a
     * Comparator, it must be searched using the same Comparator, which is
     * passed as the second argument to the binarySearch() method. Remember
     * that Comparators cannot be used when searching arrays of primitives.
