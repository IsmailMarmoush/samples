// First problem the dog/ transient collar problem

 * option? Are we stuck with a non-serializable Dog? Obviously we could subclass
 * the Collar class, mark the subclass as Serializable, and then use the Collar
 * subclass instead of the Collar class. But that's not always an option either
 * for several potential reasons:
 */
/*
 * 1. The Collar class might be final, preventing subclassing. OR
 *
 * 2. The Collar class might itself refer to other non-serializable objects, and
 * without knowing the internal structure of Collar, you aren't able to make all
 * these fixes (assuming you even wanted to TRY to go down that road). OR
 *
 * 3. Subclassing is not an option for other reasons related to your design.
 * Soï¿½THEN what do you do if you want to save a Dog? That's where the transient
 * modifier comes in.
 *
 * If you mark the Dog's Collar instance variable with transient, then
 * serialization will simply skip the Collar during serialization:
