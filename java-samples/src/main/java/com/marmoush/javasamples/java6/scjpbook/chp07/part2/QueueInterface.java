     * Queue Interface A Queue is designed to hold a list of "to-dos," or
     * things to be processed in some way. Although other orders are
     * possible, queues are typically thought of as FIFO (first-in,
     * first-out). Queues support all of the standard Collection methods and
     * they also add methods to add and subtract elements and review queue
     * elements.

    /*
     * PriorityQueue This class is new with Java 5. Since the LinkedList
     * class has been enhanced to implement the Queue interface, basic
     * queues can be handled with a LinkedList. The purpose of a
     * PriorityQueue is to create a "priority-in, priority out" queue as
     * opposed to a typical FIFO queue. A PriorityQueue's elements are
     * ordered either by natural ordering (in which case the elements
     * that are sorted first will be accessed first) or according to a
     * Comparator. In either case, the elements' ordering represents
     * their relative priority.
